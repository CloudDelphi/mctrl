**mCtrl version:**
Specify mCtrl version. Include whether it is 32-bit or 64-bit build and whether
it is Release or Debug configuration.

**Windows version:**
Specify Windows version. Is it 32-bit or 64-bit Windows? If relevant, specify
also version of other system components. For example if the bug is about the
HTML control, it can be important what version of Microsoft Explorer is 
installed on the system.

**Describe the bug:**
Describe the bug. The description should cover the following questions:
 1. What behavior do you expect?
 2. What behavior do you get?
 3. How to reproduce the issue?
 
**Is the issue related to building?**
If the bug is related to building mCtrl or building your project against its
headers, specify what tool(s) you are using. E.g. is it Microsoft Visual
Studio? Mingw-w64? Something else? What version of it?

**Attachments:**
If it is relevant, attach a screenshot illustrating what's wrong.

Also, if it is relevant, providing some code reproducing the issue can be vital.
Ideally in some of these forms:
 * a complete source code which can compile as a standalone C or C++ program;
 * a patch or pull request to be applied to one of the examples in mCtrl source
   tree;
 * or (if it is not overly long) as a C function (or few functions) which can
   replace whole function (or few functions) in one of those examples.
